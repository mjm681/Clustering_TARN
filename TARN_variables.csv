Clinical guidance is that: If a patient is discharged home without a CARE PACKAGE in place(i.e. they don't require a carer to perform everyday duties for them) this equates to: Good Recovery. If a patient is sent home with a CARE PACKAGE in place this equates to: Moderate Disability. If a patient is discharged to a rehab unit/ward this equates to: Severe Disability.
